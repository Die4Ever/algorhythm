-adjust volumes and maybe increase the overall volume(might make mp3 encoding better)
-pass song density into instrument creator
-give each instrument an instrument density
	-has a small chance each phrase to change by some random amount
-give each instrument a rhythm overlay
	-can change over time
	-should allow 32nd notes
-possibly generate multiple leads with a different key or synth
-pick different drum breaks at random
-more synths
-different length notes, possibly by looking back in the notes array
-mod wheels!
	-how to compose with mod wheels?
		-I guess just same motif-arrangement style as everything else?
